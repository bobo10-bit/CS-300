# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this project I was trying to solve two problems. One of these problems was to print all of the computer science courses in alphabetical order. The second problem was to print the course information with the prerequisites for a givin course.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem first I had to make a pseudocode to first open and read a file for data. Then I had to create a menu system and finally sort then print all of the course information and their prerequisites. For this project I used a Binary search tree to help sort the courses. Data structures are important to understand because when sorting data there are many ways to sort the data. Each data structure has pros and cons and by understanding them you are able to choose the one that most matches your requirements which can help save time and computer resources.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I was able to overcome some roadblocks by first taking a break. This gave me time to think about how I should try to fix the problem and if I still can't think of a way to fix it I look up solutions online.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
By learning for about data structures I was able to expand my aproach to desgining and developing programs. This is because it has taught me about different ways I can sort data which can help me in the future when I need to use these skills to develop a project. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has taught me the imporatance of having readable, adaptable, and maintainable code. By have readable code it can allow me to fix and errors that can happen. By having adaptable code I can easily change things in the program such as adding features or cleaning the code. By having maintainable code I can keep the program maintained for a long time and get rid of any errors that can occur in the future.
